# Program Structure

Sometimes you cannot avoid missing a class. If you need to be away from class, it is your responsibility to inform your
instructor and catch up on the materials discussed in the class

### Assignments & Exercises

**You must type each in, manually. If you copy and paste, you might as well not even do them.**&#x20;

The point of these exercises is to train your hands, your brain, and your mind in how to read, write, and see code. If
you copy-paste, you are cheating yourself out of the effectiveness of the program.

We focus on materials that will help you solve practical problems as you will in the "real world."

To create and preserve a classroom atmosphere that optimizes teaching and learning, all participants share a
responsibility in creating a civil and non-disruptive forum for the discussion of idea.&#x20;

As a student, you are expected to conduct yourself at all times in a manner that does not disrupt teaching or learning.
Your comments to others should be constructive and free from harassing statements.&#x20;

You are encouraged to disagree with other students and the instructor, but such disagreements need to respectful and be
based upon facts and documentation (rather than prejudices and personalities).

Part of the learning process in this course is respectful engagement of ideas with others.
