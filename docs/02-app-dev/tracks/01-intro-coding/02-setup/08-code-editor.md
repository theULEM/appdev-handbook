# Code Editors

We use three editors to code. VS Code, PyCharm and Playcode

## Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
VS Code is a text editor. [This difference is important.](http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-ide-and-text-editor). VS Code is one of the 3 editors we split out time. It's popular for a good reason; once you primary VS Code, you can use it to code in many languages outside JavaScript.

### Installation
[Download and install VS Code here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## intelliJ (PyCharm)

If you do quick search for a coding tutorial on YouTube, changes are, they will be using VS Code. It's a great text editor but it's not Webstorm, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). [Here are the key difference between both](http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-ide-and-text-editor).

We will spend most of our time in Jetbrains and some in VS Code. Using Webstorm allows us to take advantage of "Pro" level setup without worrying too much about installing this plugin or that plugin. 

Note: We use intelliJ/PyCharm interchangeably, it's referring to the same tool. Jetbrains is the company behind Webstorm. 

### Installation
To install, [download and install it from here](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).

- [Install Key Promoter X extension](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9792-key-promoter-x)

## Jsitor
VS Code and Webstorm are for heavy duty coding and there's the other world where we might not need some that "heavy." 

We want something to quickly experiment with ideas or just share  a bit of code we're working in, that's where online code editors come in. In our case, we use [Jsitor](https://jsitor.com)

Nothing to download or install, just go to jsitor.com and start experimenting.
