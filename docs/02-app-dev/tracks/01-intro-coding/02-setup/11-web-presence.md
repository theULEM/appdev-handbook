# Your Web Presence

You should have a professional presence on these platforms, as well as a professional email account. A [personal brand](http://blog.thefirehoseproject.com/posts/personal-branding-software-developer/) is really important.

Let's examine how to setup on each.

## LinkedIn
LinkedIn is a professional social network. Most people the professional world will assume you have one, if you don't, it _might_ seem off. 

Follow this guide to [create your LinkedIn account](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-LinkedIn-Account)

### Things to do
- Use a picture that clearly shows you face
- Use your legal name

## GitHub

While LinkedIn is a general professional social network, GitHub is a software focused social network.

OK. 

Its primary use is not as a social network but a place we store our code and work with other developers. Here's how to [create you GitHub account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/version-control/git-create-github-account?view=vs-2022)

### Some additional things to do
- Use a clear picture of yourself (ideally the same you used on LinkedIn)
- Use a username that includes your name, ideally, short. (For example, my name is "Dele Omotosho", my username is @deletosh)
