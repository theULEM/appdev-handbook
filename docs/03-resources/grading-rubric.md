| **Specifications** | The program works and meets all of the specifications.                                         | The program works and produces the correct results and displays them correctly. It also meets most of the other specifications.        | The program produces correct results but does not display them correctly.                                       | The program is producing incorrect results.                                                                 |
| **Readability**    | The code is exceptionally well organized and very easy to follow.                              | The code is fairly easy to read.                                                                                                       | The code is readable only by someone who knows what it is supposed to be doing                                  | The code is poorly organized and very difficult to read.                                                    |
| **Reusability**    | The code could be reused as a whole or each routine could be reused.                           | Most of the code could be reused in other programs.                                                                                    | Some parts of the code could be reused in other programs.                                                       | The code is not organized for reusability.                                                                  |
| **Documentation**  | The documentation is well written and clearly explains what the code is accomplishing and how. | The documentation consists of embedded comment and some simple header documentation that is somewhat useful in understanding the code. | The documentation is simply comments embedded in the code with some simple header comments separating routines. | The documentation is simply comments embedded in the code and does not help the reader understand the code. |
| **Delivery**       | The program was delivered on time.                                                             | The program was delivered within a week of the due date.                                                                               | The code was within 2 weeks of the due date.                                                                    | The code was more than 2 weeks overdue.                                                                     |
| **Efficiency**     | The code is extremely efficient without sacrificing readability and understanding.             | The code is fairly efficient without sacrificing readability and understanding.                                                        | The code is brute force and unnecessarily long                                                                  | The code is huge and appears to be patched together                                                         |
