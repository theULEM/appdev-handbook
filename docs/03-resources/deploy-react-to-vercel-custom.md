# Deploy a React website with Custom Domain on Vercel

* [Purchase a domain](https://tld-list.com/)
* Build a site or a simple placeholder.
* Push your site to GitHub and [link it to Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git/vercel-for-github#deploying-a-github-repository)
* Deploy the React.js built app
* Go to vercel.com, click **DOMAINS**
* Select **ADD DOMAIN**
* Type in the URL of domain in step 1

* Go to the host site and type in the A RECORD into the DNS RECORDS

* Go back to vercel.com
* Once the A-RECORD is approved VERCEL will create an SSL CERTIFICATE.
* This step took about five minutes for me.
* Once that was complete I went to a browser and typed in the URL and it forwarded me to the VERCEL page that was my REACT project.
* I type 1980.social and it redirects to Vercel page
