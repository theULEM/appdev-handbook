## Introduction

Welcome to your personalized guide for transitioning into tech! As you progress through the MSIMBO program, this roadmap will help you navigate from learning to landing your first tech job. Our approach is unique: we start by understanding what employers want and work our way backwards to shape your journey.

Here's an overview of the process:

1. Identify target roles based on current market demands
2. Build your personal brand to match these roles

Example roles to consider:
