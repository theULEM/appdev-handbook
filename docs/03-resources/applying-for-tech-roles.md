# Applying for Tech Roles

***

After completing a Bootcamp, it's difficult to know how to best use your new skills to enter the job marketplace. This guide will share the key steps on how to leverage your previous experience and new skills to enter your new career with confidence.

Here's an overview of the process:

1. Review and shortlist openings.
2. Prepare your resume to fit the roles.
3. Apply.
4. \[Bonus] Highlight how you stand out.

### 1. Review and shortlist openings.

Congrats on reaching the end of MSIMBO. You now have the skills to apply for one of the following roles:

* [Junior/Entry Front End Web Developer](https://www.coursera.org/articles/front-end-developer)
* [Junior/Entry Back End Web Developer](https://www.coursera.org/articles/back-end-developer)
* [Junior/Entry Product Manager](https://craft.io/resources/knowledge-hub/the-role-of-the-junior-product-manager/)
* [Junior/Entry Technical Project Manager](https://www.coursera.org/articles/technical-project-manager)
* [Junior/Entry QA and Test Engineer](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Career/Entry-Level-QA-Tester/What-Is-How-to-Become)
* [Web Designer](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/web-design)
* [Web Producer](https://www.zippia.com/web-producer-jobs/what-does-a-web-producer-do/)
* [Junior/Entry Developer Marketer](https://www.jobhero.com/career-guides/interviews/prep/what-is-a-content-developer)
* [Junior/Entry Technical Business Analyst](https://www.modernanalyst.com/Resources/Articles/tabid/115/ID/5235/What-Does-a-Technical-Business-analyst-do.aspx)
* No or Low-Code Developer (Supabase, AirTable, Bubble, WordPress)
* [Junior/Entry Database Administrator ](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Career/Entry-Level-Database-Administrator/What-Is-How-to-Become)

Different companies have differing stacks and how they advertise the roles and that's why we want to do the work of "reading" the market.

We start with a shortlist of relevant openings.

To shortlist, go to one of the [these job sites](https://www.apollotechnical.com/best-job-search-websites/), pick 4 openings per role and save this in a Google spreadsheet. This way, you can easily track your progress through the process.

So, if you're interested in _Junior/Entry Front-End Web Developer_, _Junior/Entry Technical Project Manager_ and _Junior/Entry Developer Marketer_, you will have 12 openings in your spreadsheet (4 opening \* 3 roles).

In the spreadsheet, save the following in the columns:

* The job title (as posted by the company)
* The job summary
* The tech requirement
* A link to the application site
* Applied (this will be empty)

This is your shortlist.

Now on to the next step:

### 2. Prepare your resume to fit the roles.

You should have had one of MSIMBO's team member reviews and help with your resume. If you don't have a resume yet, start with [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RjKDVjWPy\_wOm6F7XtFvd3Gotw3Wohc9oWfOi7nyHlA/copy).

### 3. Apply.

With a reviewed resume, apply for each of the openings in your spreadsheet. [Get the tracking template here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fZRvTiQYFX\_EuLo5dSqQHBr\_dCNfODIwSWkoCAPnuMw/copy)

Add the date you applied to the "Applied" column in your spreadsheet.

### 4. \[Bonus] Highlight how you differ.

Most prospect stop at just applying for a role and call it a day — not you. Let's add this additional tip that makes you stand out.

After you've applied for a role, if you feel an opening is a real great fit, take the extra step to send the hiring manager an email.

Here's how to do this.

1. Find out what department's hiring from the job posting.
2. Use Google via LinkedIn to find the department or organization that is hiring for this role (Engineering, Marketing, Finance, IT, etc.).
3. On [google.com](https://www.google.com), type this query: `site:www.linkedin.com/in OR site:www.linkedin.com/pub "<Name of Department + Role * * * * * * – Present"` Department will be what you found from step 2, and "Role" will be the tile of the head of the department, often, "Director", "VP", "Manager", etc. For example: Here's a sample query: `site:www.linkedin.com/in OR site:www.linkedin.com/pub "Engineering Director * * * * * * – Present"`
4. Using the name you found, go to [https://hunter.io](https://hunter.io/) to find their email (or the company's email pattern like first.lastname@company.com).
5.  Send a nice email like this:

    Subject: Re: Title of Role

    Dear X,

    I appreciate the work you and your team are doing on \[something nice they're doing at the company] and look forward to joining the team.

    \[the exact copy of your summary section from your resume]

    I've applied, and it will be a pleasure to work with you and the team.

    Yours in anticipation, \[Your name]

While you might not get a response to this email, it impresses you on the mind of the internal folks at the company.

### How to quickly get experience in the "Real World"
A big concern on your mind might be: "how do I get started in software IF I don't have any experience at all?" — what do I included on my resume?

Here's a cheatsheet to gain experience you can slap on your resumé: be an open source software contributor.

It's not paid but it gives you a lot of experience from experts.

Here's how:

1. In software development, start contributing to beginner friendly issues, find one here (filter by your language of choice): https://goodfirstissue.dev
2. For Product or other dev-adjacent roles: volunteer with project leads/founders. 
	1. Find a project with open community calls that meet regularly: Google: `open source + "community call"` (not the " " around the community call, that's important)
	2. Join the next call and listen in — then make your ask at the end (where appropriate). The leads/founders are always on the call and are often happy to support you contribute to their project AND they always need help with something.
	3. Here's an example of one: https://docs.naas.ai/contributing-to-naas/community-events 

Outside of the immediate real-world of learning how modern software is built, you make friends with software crafters that can help network you to opportunities that are not public.
